* Chapter 1: Pedagogy of Virtual Labs
**  Introduction and Overview
   Virtual Lab is a collection of many virtual lab
   experiments. Each experiment would cover certain aspects
   of a lab. Designing a Virtual Lab experiment consists of
   well defined logical steps. These steps include.

    1. *Round 0 -* It consists of a brief overview of the
       virtual LAB and should contain broad objectives,
       outcomes, brief overview on software used etc. One
       has to also mention the experiments that will be
       covered in this LAB.

    2. *Round 1 (Pedagogy)-* From this stage, every experiment
       in a given lab needs to have a seperate
       documentation. In this stage learning objectives and
       pedagogy for experiments needs to be clearly defined

    3. *Round 2 (Storyboard)-* After freezing the pedagogy
       and the instructional strategy. One can start
       designing the story, mindmap, flowchart and
       storyboard in the section

    4. *Round 3 (Lab Manual)-* In round 3, the developer
       designs the lab manual and the programmers code for
       the virtual lab simulator At this point the developer
       should form groups with other faculty and students
       and begin the coding for the experiment
       simulation. The coding should be done ONLY in FOSS
       (Free and Open Source) based software

    5. *Round 4 (Code Development)-* In this stage integration
       of different components should be done using the LDK
       (Framework-Template). And when the lab template is
       ready, it must be submitted for approval.

    6. *Round 5-* This is the final stage where review and
       approval would be done by the virtual labs team.

** 1.1 Focus Area
    Focus area is the area of focus in any virtual lab
    experiment. There are few main focus areas:

    1. *Reinforce theoretical concept:* Reinforcing a
       concept that is required for a student to understand
       higher level concepts is very important. One must
       define this focus area if the developer wants to
       reinforce previously learnt concept.

    2. *Instrumental and Practical Skills:* This area
       focuses on instrumentation, practical skills and demo
       experiments. In other words, the student is required
       to acquire the skill of using an instrument or learn
       the process of an experiment rather than focusing on
       data analysis.

    3. *Experimentation:* Experimentation focuses on the
       process of experimentation including the protocol and
       understanding different methodologies in an
       experiment.

    4. *Data Analysis:* Data analysis as the name suggests
       involves analyzing data obtained after performing the
       experiment. Some experiments may have rigorous data
       analysis and conclusions are based on the data
       analysed.

    5. *Modelling:* There are experiments in which a student
       might have to apply different models or different
       theories to understand the working of an experiment
       or the theory behind the experiment.

    6. *Learn from failure:* Learning from failure is one of
       the most important areas where students can take full
       advantage of virtual lab technology. One can
       understand how malfunctioning of an instrument can
       result in error or failure and can repeat the
       experiment correctly in virtual environment.

   While choosing these focus areas, one can choose multiple
   focus areas for a given experiment. But one has to keep
   in mind that the focus areas chosen should be well
   justified and logically selected to avoid any discrepancy
   with learning objectives and instructional strategy.

** 1.2 Learning Objectives and Bloom's taxonomy
*** 1.2.1 Learning Objectives
    Learning objectives are objectives set by the proposer
    or instructor that has to be achieved. Learning
    objectives help in defining the accurate coverage and
    flow of a virtual lab simulation. Defining proper
    learning objectives acts as a checkpoint for a developer
    to ensure complete coverage of a virtual lab experiment.
*** 1.2.2 Bloom's Taxonomy
    But in order to write good learning objectives Bloom's
    taxonomy should be used. Dr Benjamin Bloom invented a
    way of classifying learning objectives now known as
    Bloom¡¯s Taxonomy. There are 6 levels of objectives or
    cognitive levels in Bloom's taxonomy which should be
    used in developing an experiment This taxonomy
    classifies learning based on cognitive skills.
    
    <<figure>>

   Cognition means, the process of acquiring knowledge
   through means like thinking, reasoning, observing, memory
   recall etc. Some of the cognitive skills are easy for
   students to grasp, but some are very difficult. Bloom's
   classified the important cognitive skills to improve
   learning and promote learning skills in students.
*** 1.2.3 Bloom's Taxonomy: Action Verbs
   Further these cognitive levels are mapped to action
   verbs. Action verbs are words that define some
   action. Examples of action verbs include describe,
   explain, state, apply, solve etc. Bloom's taxonomy action
   verbs are only "single word that carry an action". These
   action words describe the cognitive processes by which
   thinkers encounter knowledge.

   A complete set of verbs which can be used to formulate
   learning objectives at the various levels of Bloom's
   taxonomy are given in the following table.

   |------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Level      | Action Verbs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

   |------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   
    While writing learning objective one should ensure the
    sentence starts with an action verb. For example, an LO
    could be:

       1. Describe how a cloud formation occurs during
          formation of hurricane
       2. Explain different factors that affect friction
       3. List the countries which had low GDP than India in
          the year 2017-2018

   So in all the examples above the statement has begun with
   an action verb followed by the instruction or
   objective. It is also important to use the right action
   verb to achieve the correct LO.  

  *Learning objectives-Do's & Don'ts:*

   As per the definition of learning objectives they need to
   be very specific and measurable hence you should not use
   verbs such as understand, visualize etc instead use
   action verbs such as identify, list, describe, solve etc.

   Similarly the learning objective should be concerned with
   the learner and not the teacher hence avoids using verbs
   such as teach, show, demonstrate etc.

   The learning objectives should be clearly listed down and
   a cognitive level should be assigned to it. For example:
   
   |---------+--------------------------------------------------------+-------------------|
   | *Sr.No* | *Learning Objective*                                   | *Cognitive Level* |
   |---------+--------------------------------------------------------+-------------------|
   |      1. | Identify the set-up, test section, pumping mechanism   | Recall            |
   |         | and measurement of flow rate and pressure drop         |                   |
   |---------+--------------------------------------------------------+-------------------|
   |      2. | To enable the student to describe the methodology to   | Understand        |
   |         | perform the experiment                                 |                   |
   |---------+--------------------------------------------------------+-------------------|
   |      3. | Use the fundamental and empirical equations to         | Apply             |
   |         | calculate the various entities                         |                   |
   |---------+--------------------------------------------------------+-------------------|
   |      4. | Examine and compare the calculated values with the     | Analyze           |
   |         | experimental ones                                      |                   |
   |---------+--------------------------------------------------------+-------------------|
   |      5. | Realize the significance of controlling                | Evaluate          |
   |         | variables/parameters and visualize their effect on the |                   |
   |         | desired entity                                         |                   |
   |---------+--------------------------------------------------------+-------------------|
   |      6. | Solve an open-ended problem related to the existing    | Create            |
   |         | infrastructure or real world                           |                   |
   |---------+--------------------------------------------------------+-------------------|
   
   It is expected to develop a lab or prepare experiment
   pedagogy, based on 6 cognitive levels namely; RECALL,
   UNDERSTAND, APPLY, ANALYZE, EVALUATE and CREATE. It is
   expected to lay more emphasis on the last three
   levels. However none or very few of the physical
   experiments touch upon the last two cognitive levels.

   For e.g. in the case of the experiment in Fluid
   Mechanics, Friction in Circular pipe: the first step may
   be to include the first four cognitive levels.

   |------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Recall     | Identify the layout of the experimental set-up, the equipment and the              |
   |            | instruments used therein, various technical terms involved (Reynolds'              |
   |            | number, friction factor, pressure drop etc.). This is based on the theory given    |
   |            | in the manual/experiment.                                                          |
   |------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Understand | The student should know and understand the rationale of the experiment and         |
   |            | the procedure to perform it. This also includes knowing the functionality of the   |
   |            | various devices used (rotameter, manometer, pump etc.), the flow patterns          |
   |            | and the connectivity with the real world. Additionally the understanding the       |
   |            | theoretical correlations is equally important.                                     |
   |------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Apply      | Based on the experimental observations and the data generated/collected            |
   |            | and the theoretical correlations, the student should be able to calculate the      |
   |            | various entities (velocity, pressure drop and friction factor) and summarize the   |
   |            | same using relevant plots.                                                         |
   |------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Analyze    | Based on the observed data and the calculations the student should be able         |
   |            | to appreciate and compare the observed and the theoretical values and the          |
   |            | variables/parameters affecting the same. In the traditional version this falls     |
   |            | under Results and Discussion                                                       |
   |------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Evaluate   | Based on the obtained values and the plots, the student should be able to put      |
   |            | forth reasonable conclusions. Further to this it should be possible to go one      |
   |            | step beyond this and think about the effect of change in the architecture          |
   |            | (diameter of pipe, length of pipe etc.) on the result.                             |
   |------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
   | Create     | This aspect involves a segment of open-endedness. Students should be able          |
   |            | to or motivated to think out of the box and propose alternate ways to perform      |
   |            | the experiment. This may involve proposing different but viable analytical         |
   |            | tools or even multiple test sections to study the effect of additional variables.  |
   |            | For example in the case of Friction in Circular Pipe this level may involve        |
   |            | proposing pressure sensors/transducers for pressure measurement and pipes          |
   |            | of different sizes, cross-section and length to study their effect on the friction |
   |            | factor. However simulation for the same calls in for real time data which either   |
   |            | needs to be generated or should be available from the literature. This calls in    |
   |            | for a possible integration with the modular laboratory set-ups which can help      |
   |            | address this aspect.                                                               |

** 1.3 Instructional Strategy
   *Introduction*

   Instruction is a combination of teaching and learning
   activities. Instruction is a whole process that includes
   facilitating the learning process and guiding the
   students. Strategy means ¡°plan of action¡±. Instructional
   strategy helps in choosing which approach or strategy to
   use while

   *Types of instructional strategies:*
   <<image>>
 
   There are four types of instructional strategies:

   Expository  

   'Do as per the instructions¡¯ - Stereotype
   protocol. Almost all the physical labs follow this
   methodology. Thus it addresses only the first three
   cognitive levels. Moreover, it does not involve critical
   thinking and analysis.

   Guided inquiry

   This includes the primary level of open-endedness. The
   objectives and the theory is explained or given. The
   students are asked to propose a methodology to address
   the objectives leading to data analysis, Results and
   Conclusions. For e.g. in the case of Friction in Circular
   Pipe the students may be given the test section and a
   pump. The students are supposed to find alternate but
   feasible ways to measure the flow rate and the pressure
   drop. They may use a graduated cylinder or a two-tank
   system to measure the flow rate. For measuring the
   pressure drop they may use a pressure gauge, pressure
   sensor or transducer instead of a manometer. Such
   strategies can be implemented with relative ease in
   Computer science, CAD, Electrical Engg. and to a certain
   extent in Physical sciences.

   Problem based

   This is based on posing a problem associated with the
   theory with the available lab resources. The learning
   objectives are often defined. The students are expected
   to brainstorm and propose a design methodology. This
   could be similar to constructing something from a Mechano
   set. For e.g. in the case of Friction Factor
   determination in a pipe, the student has to figure out
   the cross-section, diameter and the length of the pipe
   based on the available resources and then assemble
   them. This may also involve selecting and proposing the
   right type of pump. This protocol should ultimately lead
   to data analysis, comparison, results &amp; discussion
   and conclusions.

   Project based

   This to a greater extent overlaps on the Problem based
   strategy with the only difference being the problem
   statement is associated with the real world. In the case
   of determination of friction factor, the problem may be
   posed as follows: ¡®A pipeline needs to be designed for
   given flow conditions with a limitation on the pressure
   drop and the pump required to cater to this service be
   specified¡¯. Thus, the objectives are well defined but the
   remaining protocol needs to be proposed by the students.


** 1.4 Task and Assessments

   Assessments are tools an instructor can use to understand
   whether students have understood the concept. One way to
   assess students is to make the students perform a task in
   the simulator.  While performing the task, students will
   have to use different skills like observation, analysis,
   logically predict outcome etc. and then infer the
   solution.  A simple solution to deciding task is to check
   for learning objectives defined for that experiment and
   build task and assessment corresponding every learning
   object.

   Assessment methods

   Typically two types of assessment methods are used
   namely; Formative and Summative. Almost all the
   Institutes in India use the summative method wherein the
   assessment is done after performing the experiment or
   towards the end of the semester during the viva
   examination. Formative is often quite rigorous and time
   consuming. On the VLabs platform formative may mean that
   when the student enters a value which needs to be
   calculated and if the same in incorrect, the virtual
   simulator will display an error message which will
   eventually reduce the credits for a given experiment
   (this aspect needs to be incorporated while
   coding). Alternatively a question will be posed by the
   simulator prior to entering the value prompting the
   student to enter the range in which the value is likely
   to lie.

   Formative assessment:Assessments part of the learning
   process to enhance or understand whether a student is
   able to grasp. This happens during the process of
   learning.

   Summative assessment:Summative Assessments: Assessments
   conducted after the learning has been completed to test
   student¡¯s understanding of a concept. This happens after
   the process of learning.

   Relating LO's, Assessments and Tasks

   A simple solution to deciding task is to check for
   learning objectives defined for that experiment and build
   task and assessment corresponding every LO.

   <<image>> 

   So the crux of it is, every LO needs to have a task and
   assessment question. The task could be performing some
   action in the simulation and then attempting assessment
   questions in the form of MCQ¡¯s. For example, we could ask
   the student to set the values of a parameter through
   slider and observe the reading in an apparatus and then
   analyse the data to interpret the results. Using this we
   can figure out the engagement level of the student as
   well.
** 1.5 Simulator Interactions
   Simulator interaction is the capability of the simulator
   to provide interactive features to the user. This lets
   the user explore the interactive capabilities of the
   simulator to enhance the learning outcome.

   So simulator interactions serves two main aspects

    1. Interactivity capabilities of the simulator

    2. Enhancing learning outcome through interactivity and
       increasing engagement level of the user.


   In the simulator interactions section a developer must
   provide information on:

   What will the students do?

   This section contains information on the inputs provided
   by the user or the student. This could be different
   inputs that would change from one simulation to
   another. For instance, it could be changing the value of
   a particular parameter, or it could be selecting some
   items from the drop down menu. The inputs provided by the
   user should be useful for getting output from the
   simulator and serve some meaningful purpose.

   What will the simulator do?

   This section contains the information pertaining to the
   feedback that the simulator will provide depending on the
   inputs provided by the user. Note that the action by the
   user or the student should have one to one
   correspondence. One has to give the detailed information
   on the simulator¡¯s interactivity.

   Purpose of the task?

   The Main purpose of the task section one has to justify
   the purpose or the objective of the task the user does to
   get some interactive feedback from the simulator. This
   section mainly should explain how learning will happen
   through the student¡¯s input and simulator¡¯s feedback.

   All the three sections have 1 to 1 relation and one must
   note that there should be logical and well reasoned
   philosophy behind the purpose giving each and every
   specifics.
