* Chapter 2: Strategies and Visualisation

** 2.1 Story Outline and Story:
   Story Outline 

   The story outline should give a brief idea about the
   story. This could be 2 or 3 paragraphs.The story would
   contain all the information regarding the coverage of the
   virtual lab experiment.

   Story

   After writing the story outline, one has to now proceed
   to write an elaborative story. The story should be in
   simple English language. It should be logical and should
   make sense giving all the details of the coverage of the
   entire virtual lab experiment

   The story should cover some key points, they are:

       - Set the Visual Stage description

       - Set the User objectives and goals

       - Set the pathway activities

       - Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/ Variations

       - Allow Pitfalls

       - Conclusion

       - Equations/ Formulas

     *Set the Visual Stage description:* 

     This is simply the stage on which the user will land on
     opening the simulation. One must mention all the visual
     elements seen by the user in the landing section. It
     could have different elements like buttons, sliders,
     drop down menus or some image with text.. One has to
     list them down in a simple language so that one can
     visualise how the landing page would look like

    *Set the User objectives and goals:* 

     In this sectio, one should describe the objectives and
     goals of the experiment. The objectives and the goals
     should be written clearly and explain how the
     experiment would begin and what would be the flow of
     the experiment. This should not be confused with
     bloom's LO's as this is experiment specific objective
     and not concept specific LO.

     *Set the pathway activities:* 
     
     Pathway means the path required to achieve a particular
     objective. So pathway activities implies how a user
     will traverse through the experiment. There could be
     several pathways on achieving the objectives but one
     should ensure that an effective pathway is chosen.

     *Set Challenges and Questions/Complexity/ Variations:*

     In this section one has to set challenges based on the
     user's level. By user's level it means, for set of weak
     students even a easy challenge can be difficult. So it
     is important to define the level of challenge
     properly. These challenges could be questions or
     problem solving. It would help the user in two ways,
     one is to invoke curiosity and interest and other to
     ensure learning and relearning.

     *Allow Pitfalls:*

     We often say that people learn from experiences.  These
     experiences help clearing misconceptions,
     misunderstandings. The same thing holds true here, to
     "allow pitfalls" means to put the user in a situation
     where the user can make mistakes and then re-learn from
     it. This can be done in different ways, like allowing
     pitfalls in challenges or tricky questions. This would
     also help us understand the engagement factor of user.
  
     *Conclusion:*

     This may include displaying: how much time was taken?/
     How many questions were right?/ How many hints did the
     learner use. Based on this the evaluation/marking to be
     suggested to the user. Once the user is towards the
     completion of the experiment, there should be
     descriptive interpretation based on the user's
     performance.  For example, It could be the user has
     understood properly and which LO needs more effort
 
     *Equations/ Formulas:* 

     These equations and formulas responsible for the
     working of experiment should be mentioned in a separate
     sheet. These equations could be written with a brief
     description about the dependent and independent
     variables and which equation is used where. Thus these
     formulas and equations basically govern the entire
     experiment and should be mentioned clearly so that one
     can easily troubleshoot in case of any difficulty
** 2.2 Flowchart
   
   Flowchart is a diagram that helps us understand a
   process. For instance if you had a robot and want to set
   instructions for it. One simple way is to do it as shown
   in the figure.
   <<image>>

  The steps should be logical and reasoned. A flowchart
  basically gives us a logical flow and it is used in
  virtual lab experiments to define the process involved in
  the virtual lab experiment. The process could involve
  steps that has to be followed and instructions must be
  provided with a proper drawing. One can draw the flowchart
  and save the flowchart as .png.
** 2.3 Mindmap
   A mind map is a diagram used to visually organize
   information. A simple mind map can look like this: 
   <<image>>
   
   The main objective of mind map is to visually represent
   sub concepts linked to the main concept. The topic or the
   main topic is located at the center and is connected to
   subtopics independently. Furthermore these subtopics can
   be further connected to micro level of subtopics.

   For example Heat ---measured by -----> thermometer ----- can be  ----> gas thermometer. 
** 2.4 Storyboard
   A storyboard is a graphic organizer in the form of
   illustrations or images displayed in sequence. It is used
   for the purpose of pre-visualizing a motion picture, or
   interactive media sequence.
   
   <<image>>

   In this case it is the virtual lab simulation. Making a
   general storyboard is very simple. Storyboard can be
   drawn frame by frame and what is to be present can be
   represented via cartoons, objects etc. One can make
   storyboard using https://wonderunit.com/storyboarder/. Or
   can use any other Open Source Image editing / drawing
   tool
