#### 3. Instructional Strategy
|Metohd |	Assessment	| Instruction Strategy
|:--|:--|:--| 
A list of numbers to be sorted is given. Students use primitive actions (compare and swap on adjacent elements) to sort the array. <br>Through this, they gain hands-on experience and knowledge on how bubble sort works. | Ask them questions like the following to test their comprehension <br>True or False: Bubble sort will take N operations to find the position of 1 element in the list of N elements. |Expository |
